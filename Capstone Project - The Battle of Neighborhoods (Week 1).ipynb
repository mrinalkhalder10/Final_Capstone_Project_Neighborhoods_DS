    "    Toronto is the provincial capital of Ontario and the most populous city in Canada, with a population of 2,731,571 .\n",

    "    According to the United Nations Development Programme, Toronto has the second-highest percentage of constant foreign-born   population among world cities, after Miami, Florida. While Miami's foreign-born population has traditionally consisted primarily of Cubans and other Latin Americans, no single nationality or culture dominates Toronto's immigrant population, placing it among the most diverse cities in the world. In 2010, it was estimated over 100,000 immigrants arrive in the Greater Toronto Area each year.   \n",

    "    Food is a big deal in Toronto. Not only do we need it to live, but we’ve come into our own as a foodie destination. New restaurants are constantly opening, and chefs continue to push culinary boundaries to come up with new and innovative ideas. It’s a bit dizzying just how MUCH good stuff there is to eat here.\n",
